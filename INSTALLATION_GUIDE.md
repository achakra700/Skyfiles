# SkyFiles - Installation & Build Guide üáÆüá≥

## Quick Start (If you have Java installed)

1. **Run the build script:**
   ```bash
   .\build_skyfiles.bat
   ```
   or
   ```powershell
   .\build_skyfiles.ps1
   ```

2. **Find your executable:**
   - Look in: `build/compose/binaries/main-release/exe/SkyFiles-Setup.exe`
   - This is your installable Windows application!

## If Java is NOT installed

### Step 1: Install Java JDK 17+

**Option A: Download from Adoptium (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
2. Download "JDK 17" for Windows x64
3. Run the installer
4. Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation

**Option B: Download from Oracle**
1. Go to: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
2. Download JDK 17 for Windows
3. Install and add to PATH

### Step 2: Verify Java Installation
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```bash
java -version
